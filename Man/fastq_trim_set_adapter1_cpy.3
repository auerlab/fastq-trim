.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_adapter1_cpy(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, char * new_adapter1, size_t array_size)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_adapter1    The new value for adapter1
array_size      Size of the adapter1 array.
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for adapter1 member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set adapter1 in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_adapter1 to ->adapter1.

Note that there is an equivalent macro FASTQ_TRIM_SET_ADAPTER1(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_adapter1 is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
char *          new_adapter1;
size_t          array_size;

if ( fastq_trim_set_adapter1(&fastq_trim, new_adapter1, array_size) == FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK )
{
