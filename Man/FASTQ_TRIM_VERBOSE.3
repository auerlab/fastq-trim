.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for verbose.  Use this macro to reference verbose in
a fastq_trim_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the fastq_trim_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
bool            verbose;

verbose = FASTQ_TRIM_VERBOSE(&fastq_trim);
.ad
.fi

See fastq-trim.h for a full list of macros.
