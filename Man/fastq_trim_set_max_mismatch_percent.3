.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_max_mismatch_percent(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, unsigned new_max_mismatch_percent)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_max_mismatch_percent The new value for max_mismatch_percent
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for max_mismatch_percent member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set max_mismatch_percent in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
max_mismatch_percent is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_max_mismatch_percent is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
