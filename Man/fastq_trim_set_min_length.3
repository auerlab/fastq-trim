.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_min_length(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, size_t new_min_length)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_min_length  The new value for min_length
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for min_length member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set min_length in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
min_length is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_min_length is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
