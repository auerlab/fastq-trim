.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_outstream1_ae(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, size_t c, FILE  new_outstream1_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
c               Subscript to the outstream1 array
new_outstream1_element The new value for outstream1[c]
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for an array element of outstream1 member in a fastq_trim_t
structure. Use this function to set an element of the array
outstream1 in a fastq_trim_t variable from non-member functions.

Note that there is an equivalent macro FASTQ_TRIM_SET_OUTSTREAM1_AE(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_outstream1_element is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
size_t          c;
FILE *          new_outstream1_element;

if ( fastq_trim_set_outstream1(&fastq_trim, c, new_outstream1_element) == FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK )
