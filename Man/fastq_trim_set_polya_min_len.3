.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_polya_min_len(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, size_t new_polya_min_len)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_polya_min_len The new value for polya_min_len
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for polya_min_len member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set polya_min_len in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
polya_min_len is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_polya_min_len is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.na

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
size_t          new_polya_min_len;
