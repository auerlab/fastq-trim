.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_adapter_match_function(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, trim_afp_t new_adapter_match_function)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_adapter_match_function The new value for adapter_match_function
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for adapter_match_function member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set adapter_match_function in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
adapter_match_function is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_adapter_match_function is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
