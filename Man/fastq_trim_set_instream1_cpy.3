.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_instream1_cpy(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, FILE * new_instream1, size_t array_size)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_instream1   The new value for instream1
array_size      Size of the instream1 array.
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for instream1 member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set instream1 in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function copies the array pointed to
by new_instream1 to ->instream1.

Note that there is an equivalent macro FASTQ_TRIM_SET_INSTREAM1(), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_instream1 is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
FILE *          new_instream1;
size_t          array_size;

if ( fastq_trim_set_instream1(&fastq_trim, new_instream1, array_size) == FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK )
{
}
