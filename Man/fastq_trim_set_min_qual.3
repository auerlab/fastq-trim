.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_min_qual(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, unsigned new_min_qual)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_min_qual    The new value for min_qual
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for min_qual member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set min_qual in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
min_qual is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_min_qual is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise
