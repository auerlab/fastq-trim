.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     fastq_trim_set_instream2(fastq_trim_t *fastq_trim_ptr, FILE * new_instream2)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
fastq_trim_ptr  Pointer to the structure to set
new_instream2   The new value for instream2
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for instream2 member in a fastq_trim_t structure.
Use this function to set instream2 in a fastq_trim_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
instream2 is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_instream2 is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
FASTQ_TRIM_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES

.na

fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
