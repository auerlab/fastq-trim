.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a summary of usage and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print some intermediate results during trimming for debugging purposes.

.TP
\fB\-\-exact-match\fR \fIN\fR
Use exact matching to find adapters.  Adapters will be matched if a segment
matches the entire adapter sequence, or a portion of it at the end of the
read matches to a minimum of min_match (default=3, controlled by
--min-match) characters.  The default matching algorithm used when
--exact-match is not specified is described below.

.TP
\fB\-\-3p-adapter1\fR \fIseq\fR
Specify the 3' adapter for single-end mode and read1 in paired-end mode.
Default is the Illumina universal
adapter, AGATCGGAAGAG.  Use fastq-vis(1) to identify other standard adapters
in the input.

.TP
\fB\-\-3p-adapter1\fR \fIseq\fR
Specify the 3' adapter for read2 in paired-end mode.
Default is the Illumina universal
adapter, AGATCGGAAGAG.  Use fastq-vis(1) to identify other standard adapters
in the input.

.TP
\fB\-\-min-match\fR \fIN\fR
Minimum number of bases in the read that must match the adapter in order
to report a match.  This applies to both exact matching and smart matching.

.TP
\fB\-\-max-mismatch-percent\fR \fIN\fR
Maximum percentage of bases in the read can differ from the adapter and
still consider it a match.  This applies only to smart matching.

.TP
\fB\-\-min-qual\fR \fIN\fR
Minimum quality of bases to keep for end-trimming.  Default is 20.

.TP
\fB\-\-min-length\fR \fIN\fR
Minimum length of reads to keep after trimming.  Default is 30.

.TP
\fB\-\-phred-base\fR \fIN\fR
Offset used for characters in quality string.  Default is 33, which should
be the correct value for virtually all modern sequence data.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B Fastq-trim
removes adapters and low-quality bases from the ends of each read in a
FASTQ file.  Reads with a length less than the specified or default
minimum are not output.

The default "smart" adapter matching allows for roughly 10% of the bases to be
substituted.  No insertions or deletions are currently handled for adapter
matching.

Exact matching can be selected using --exact-match.
In either case, a minimum of min_match (default 3, controlled by
--min-match) bases must be matched in order to decide that the sequence
is indeed an adapter.

Low-quality 3' end removal uses the same algorithm as fastq and cutadapt,
namely scanning backward from the 3' end until the sum of (score - min-qual)
becomes > 0, then trimming at the location of the minimum sum.  Quality
trimming is done before adapter matching so that likely misread bases do not
contribute to the adapter match scoring.
