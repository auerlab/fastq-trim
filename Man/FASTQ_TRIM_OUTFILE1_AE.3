.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf 
.na
FASTQ_TRIM_OUTFILE1_AE(ptr, c)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a fastq_trim_t structure
c               Subscript to the outfile1 array
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Accessor macro for outfile1 array elements.  Use this macro to reference
an element of outfile1 in a fastq_trim_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the fastq_trim_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
fastq_trim_t    fastq_trim;
size_t          c;
char *          element;

element = FASTQ_TRIM_OUTFILE1_AE(&fastq_trim,c);
.ad
.fi
